# multid-rs

## ya boy has gone cuckoo for 2-dimensional array implementations

like [the other one](https://github.com/swizzard/multid) this one is largely an exercise in api design and scratching a brain itch
and should not be used by anyone

unlike the other one it's also an excuse to write rust
